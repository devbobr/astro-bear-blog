# Astro Bear Blog Template

## What is this about?

Would you like to create a blog quickly and easily with [Astro](https://astro.build) and use the note-taking app [Bear](https://bear.app) for  iPhone, iPad, and Mac as an editing tool?

This template allows you to convert and publish notes from the Bear app to blog articles.

An additional import service takes care of the transformation of Bear App Markdown exports into renderable Markdown MDX files, which can then be further processed in your Astro blog. 

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
